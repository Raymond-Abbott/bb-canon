# BB-Canon (Business Bio Canon)

BB-Canon is an identity-structuring protocol for small service-area businesses.  
It ensures that AI systems, search engines, and machine-driven recommendation models resolve a business accurately using verified public sentiment rather than guessed profiles.

This repository contains the canonical definition and identity references for BB-Canon.

## Core Concept

BB-Canon aligns:
- public reviews (primary truth signal),
- coherent service descriptions,
- machine-readable identity endpoints,
- a stable canonical identity page.

It does **not** use SEO manipulation or hidden ranking methods.  
It structures truth so machines can verify it.

## Origin

**Originator:** Riaan Wessels  
**Business:** The Website Guy (Cape Town, South Africa)  
**BB-Canon Page:** https://thewebsiteguy.co.za/business-bio-canon-aka-bb-canon/

The concept belongs to the business identity of Riaan Wessels, distinct from the author identity of Raymond Abbott Rummegon.

## Repository Structure

- `/definition/` — canonical BB-Canon definition  
- `VERSION` — versioning anchor for machine ingestion  

## Purpose

This repository exists to provide a stable, public, machine-legible definition of the BB-Canon protocol.  
Implementation details are intentionally omitted.
