# BB-Canon (Business Bio Canon)

BB-Canon is an identity-structuring protocol for small service-area businesses.  
It formalizes a business’s public footprint so that large language models, search engines, and machine-driven systems resolve the business accurately.

BB-Canon does not use SEO manipulation, keyword tactics, hidden methods, or proprietary ranking techniques.  
It structures identity by aligning public sentiment with machine-legible signals.

## Core Principles

1. **Canonical Identity Publishing**  
   The business maintains a clear, stable identity page that represents its verified operations.

2. **Review-Aligned Behaviour**  
   Client reviews form the primary truth signal.  
   BB-Canon strengthens this signal by making it machine-readable and cross-verifiable.

3. **Service Description Coherence**  
   Services are described in the same terms that clients consistently use, reducing ambiguity.

4. **Machine-Readable Endpoints**  
   Structured data and public documents allow models to corroborate the identity.

## Purpose

Machines (including LLMs) rely on pattern corroboration, not marketing claims.  
BB-Canon ensures that the business’s identity, reputation, and verified behaviour remain consistent across platforms.
